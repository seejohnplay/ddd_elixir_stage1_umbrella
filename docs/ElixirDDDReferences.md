# Elixir(FP) - DDD references

1. [DDD within Elixir/Phoenix project: Umbrella apps & Service Object](https://medium.com/@andreichernykh/thoughts-on-structuring-an-elixir-phoenix-project-cb083a8894ef).
2. [DDD: Aggregate roots as Elixir Processes](https://elixirforum.com/t/domain-driven-design-aggregate-roots-as-elixir-processes-genserver/4372)  Discussion in Elixir Forum
3. [Example implementation of DDD with Elixir/Phoenix](https://github.com/rpless/phoenix_ddd) Github repository.
4. [Domain Driven Design in Elixir](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/domain-driven-design-elixir-naveen-negi) May 2017 article.
5. [Using an Elixir Umbrella](https://8thlight.com/blog/georgina-mcfadyen/2017/05/01/elixir-umbrella-projects.html) - sub-apps are bounded contexts.
6. That's My Monkey (A Functional, Reactive, Domain Driven Design, and Common Sense Approach To Architecture). [LambdaDays 2017](http://www.lambdadays.org/lambdadays2017/rob-martin). Rob Martin talk [slides](http://www.lambdadays.org/static/upload/media/1487239158386169robmartinthatsmymonkey.pdf). Last third of the talk is about DDD and an FP implementation.
7. [Building a CQRS system with Elixir and Phoenix](https://10consulting.com/2017/01/04/building-a-cqrs-web-application-in-elixir-using-phoenix/). In my (Peter) opinion this is an Elixir implementation of an object-based design. That is, it does not exploit the functional aspects of Elixir.
8. ElixirDaze [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnYm0rTJNVg): Using your Umbrella. Inspired by DDD.
9. [Elixir Application Design](http://learningelixir.joekain.com/elixir-application-design-posts/) - a series of blog post by Joseph Kain.
